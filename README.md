# EQI-AFO Map

For this web map I wanted to compile something that showed the effects of animal feeding operations (AFOs) to the environment of the local area. I found data for the Environemntal Quality Index (EQI), which measures environmental quality of an area based on factors like soil and water cleanliness, among many other variables. I used a star icon to represent the animal feeding operations across the state, with different colors of icons to show the different types of livestock that the farms primarily took care of. Most are swine, then cattle and wet poultry, with only a few that are horses, sheep, and dry poultry. The EQI is shows as a choropleth map by county, with the percentile that it falls under determining te shade. The higher the percentile/the darker the shade of blue, the worse the environmental quality. The user is also able to interact with the counties and the AFO icons by clicking on them. Clicking on the county will state its name, and clicking on the star icons will show the owner of the farm.
